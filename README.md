# Fizzo Bar and Lounge (Milestone Project 1)

A website for a bar and lounge which provides an upmarket dining experience with a relaxed yet classy feel. The aim of the website is to visually convey this type of vibe and produce a higher conversion rate of visits to table bookings.
## UX
The customer needs to find the process of navigating the site as simple as possible. Although a fundamental feature, this is not always to make a booking. Accessing menus or viewing the gallery are important parts of the process leading up to the conversion to a booking. Text should be minimal with a focus on stylish imagery to optimise the enjoyment of the site visit for the user.

The owner's aim for the website is to secure table bookings via the website to increase revenue. The website will do this by a) making the booking process quick and simple for someone who wishes to book; b) selling the dining experience (classy, stylish, upmarket, relaxed) to a site visitor who is yet to make a decision to book.
### User Stories:
- As a potential customer, I want to access the menu to see what drinks and food are offered.

- As potential customer, I want to view photos of the bar and lounge so I can see what the bar and lounge looks like.

- As a customer who wishes to make a booking, I want to access a straightforward process to book a table.

- As a previous cumstomer - or one who has just completed a booking - I want to see that my continued interest in the service is valued by encouragement to follow on social media.

- As the owner of the site, I want to appeal to potential customers' desires and so that in their minds the value of the experience is greater than the cost.

## Features
**Home:** must immediately set the tone of the bar for the user - stylish and a luxurious experience. Call to action (book) but various leads to gallery, social media if customer still needs to be 'sold'.

**Menus:** one click access to PDFs of each menu available.

**Book:** one page form to allow customers to submit a booking request online so they can visit. All * fields are required to prevent an incomplete booking. Post-submit assures customer that their request as been received.

**Gallery:** displays product and service in a simple and clean format.

**Contact:** caters for minority of site visitors who are there for something other than booking or browsing.

### Colours
The proposed colour scheme for this project is a dominant colour of dark grey #616567 with accents of gold #d4af37 and a light grey/silver #e3e5e4. The concept of relative neutrality is to allow for vibrant and colourful images to be included in the project and contrast with this (e.g. cocktails).
